# JavaScript Algorithms

This repository contains a collection of JavaScript algorithms with detailed documentation and examples. Each algorithm is designed to solve a specific problem efficiently and is accompanied by test cases to ensure correctness.

## Installation

To use these algorithms, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed. Follow these steps to set up the project:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone ...
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```sh
   cd algorithm
   ```
3. Install the dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

You can use these algorithms by importing them into your JavaScript code. Below is an example of how to use one of the algorithms:

## About the crouse

An introduce to the fundamental of algorithms.
A Practical take on algorithm with javascript.
Part one of a two part (Algorithms and Data structures)

## Prerequisites :

### Modern JavaScript

- JavaScript fundamental crash crouse
- Advanced javascript crash crouse
- ES6 topics

## What is Algorithm ?

An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions to solve a particular problem.

## What is Characteristics ?

well defined inputs and outputs.
Each step should be clear and unambiguous language independent

## Why algorithms?

As a developer going to come across that you need to solve.</br>
Learning algorithms translates to learning different techniques to efficiently solve those problems.</br>
One problem can be solve in many different ways.every algorithm comes with its own tradeoffs when its come to performance.

## Algorithms analysis :

there a multiple ways to solve one problem.

## Algorithms analysis contd :

The absolute running time of an algorithm cannot be predicted , since it depends on a number of factors. </br>

- programming language use to implement the algorithm
- The computer the program runs on
- other programs running at the same time
- Quality of the operating system.

we evaluate performance of on algorithms in turn of its inputs size,

## Big O Notation

### O(1) - Constant Time

The algorithm's runtime is constant and does not change with the input size.

```javascript
function getFirstElement(arr) {
  return arr[0];
}
```
